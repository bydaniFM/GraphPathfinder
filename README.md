# GraphPathfinder
A Floyd-Warshall pathfinding algorithm implementation.

It works with a graph data structure, which contains a net of nodes, linked toguether by doubly linked, weighted paths. The algorithm searches the best route between two nodes.

The application allows for node and path creation, delete nodes and paths, print all nodes and paths, and best route search.

The code is written and commented in Spanish.
